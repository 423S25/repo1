    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Running Project Currently</h4>
            To run the project navigate to the project directory <code>"/C:/Path/To/Directory/repo1</code>.
            Then run <code>python app.py</code> for now you will need to run <code>pip install flask</code>
            and <code>pip install peewee</code> to get the proper dependencies
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Obtaining the source code</h4>
            To get the source code on your machine, run <code>git clone https://github.com/423S25/project1</code>.
            We intend to implement a package manager, but for now, make sure to have Python 3 installed, with Flask and Peewee.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Project Structure</h4>
            The directory structure is <code>/docs</code> for the documentation, <code>/src/model</code> for the database code, and <code>/templates</code> for the rendered pages.
            <code>app.py</code> (the web server) is located in the root directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Building</h4>
            At this time, no building is needed. These docs will be updated when we implement a package manager.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Testing</h4>
            Developers should be sure to test
            the core functionality of the application with every contribution. At least one approving reviewer should do
            a code review and test each contribution.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Automated Building and Testing</h4>
            At this time, we don't have any automated building or testing set up. These docs will be updated when we do.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>How to release a new version</h4>

            <h4>Additional considerations</h4>
            The code for this project is stored <a href="https://github.com/423S25/project1">here</a>.
            Developers should provide meaningful comments when contributing source code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Contribution</h4>
            This is the general expected workflow for adding a feature to the project:
            <ol>
                <li>make a branch on github</li>
                <li><code>git pull</code> on the main branch</li>
                <li><code>git checkout branch-name</code></li>
                <li>do your work, add your feature, you can save your changes to your branch</li>
                <li>push your changes (make sure you are on your branch, not main)</li>
                <li>on github, make a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch (resolve any merge conflicts)</li>
                <li>tag someone for a review</li>
                <li>once someone approves, merge it</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
