<h2>User Documentation</h2>

<h3>Note: this is a alpha release, users without experience with web development software cannot access it properly</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        This is an inventory management system for the HRDC warming center, It allows users to create new products to
        add to the inventory, update stock, price, image, ect, remove products from inventory, and display the current
        inventory. Compared to other software like Microsoft Excel, this will be designed specifically for HRDC and be
        easier to use than more generalized software. This will streamline the process of updating and tracking
        inventory at the HRDC warming center.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Accessing the software</h4>
        This is a Create, Read, Update, and Delete web application. A user will be able to access it via a url, but for
        now it can be run locally.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Starting the software</h4>
        The software can be run by entering the URL into a browser. For a local deployment, refer to the developer
        documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Using the software</h4>
        There is an intuitive user interface that will allow users to create, read, update, and delete entries in the
        inventory.
        More complete documentation on using the software will be provided when the application gets further along in
        development.
