    <h1>Group One Product Website</h1>

    <h2>Product Info</h2>
        <p>Admin access is a Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) web application to help manage inventory items.
            Currently, the system is capable of allowing users to add items and delete items from the inventory.
            Users can change the current stock, other items will be available to change by the admin in later additions.
            Log in and access control are a work in progress.
            Styling will continue to be added as we go.
            The inventory orders itself by how soon it will be till an item is out of stock.
            Items that will be out in under 7 days have a red underline</p>
    <h2>In the next release we expect to have</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved Access control</li>
            <li>Better indicators products are almost out of stock</li>
            <li>Improved HRDC branding</li>
            <li>Help making reports on inventory data</li>
            <li>Update on all item values</li>
        </ul>
        It is written using Flask (python) for a web server, Peewee ORM for data storage, and
        HTML with HTMX for a user interface.
    <h2>We also discussed doing a seperate application for staff and volunteers to use.</h2>
