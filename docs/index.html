        <p>This is a web application to help manage inventory items. It is a work in progress.
            Along with basic inventory tracking, the future goals of this project include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Access control</li>
                <li>Urgency ranking</li>
                <li>Notifications when stock runs low</li>
                <li>Help making reports on inventory data</li>
            </ul>
            It will be written using Flask (python) for a web server, Peewee ORM for data storage, and
            HTML with HTMX for a user interface.
